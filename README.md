# BEEF-Bulk-Email-Exploitation-Framework
This Python script is designed to flood a target's email inbox with spam emails. It leverages SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send multiple emails to the specified target email address. The script utilizes Python's smtplib library for handling email sending and the time module to regulate the rate of email sending.

Libraries Used:
The script relies on Python's standard libraries, primarily:
- smtplib: Used for establishing an SMTP connection to the email server and sending emails programmatically.
- time: Utilized for managing time intervals between successive email transmissions, ensuring compliance with email server limitations and optimizing delivery rat
